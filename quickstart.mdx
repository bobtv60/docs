## Welcome to UpView!

This guide will walk you through setting up UpView for your Roblox game in just a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit [dash.upview.dev](https://dash.upview.dev)
2. Click "Start Free Trial" or "Sign Up"
3. Choose to sign up with your Roblox account for seamless integration
4. Complete the onboarding process

<Note>
  UpView integrates directly with your Roblox account, so you can easily manage your games and access game data.
</Note>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Workspace

After creating your account, you'll be guided through setting up your first workspace:

1. **Name your workspace** - This is where you'll organize your games and feedback
2. **Connect your Roblox games** - Select which games you want to track
3. **Generate your API key** - This is how your game will communicate with UpView

  Your workspace is like a project folder where you can organize multiple games and their feedback. You can create additional workspaces later if needed.
</Card>

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

Your API key is essential for connecting your Roblox game to UpView:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Key** in your dashboard
2. Click **Generate New Key** if you don't have one
3. Copy your API key (it starts with `upv_`)

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. You can regenerate it anytime if needed.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Integrate with Your Roblox Game

### Install the UpView Module

1. In Roblox Studio, go to **View** → **Toolbox**
2. Search for "UpView" or use the module ID: `73920509284272`
3. Insert the module into your game

### Add the Integration Code

Add this simple code to a Script in ServerScriptService:

```lua
local UpView = require(73920509284272)

UpView.init({
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", -- Replace with your actual API key
    gameId = game.GameId
})
```

<Note>
  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the API key you copied from your dashboard.
</Note>

### Enable HTTP Requests

Make sure HTTP requests are enabled in your game:

1. In Roblox Studio, go to **Game Settings**
2. Under **Security**, enable **Allow HTTP Requests**
3. Save your game

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

1. Publish your game to Roblox
2. Play your game and submit some test feedback
3. Check your UpView dashboard to see the feedback appear
